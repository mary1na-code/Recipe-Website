# 🧑‍🍳 Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help sharpen your skills by recreating real-world designs with clean and accessible code.

## 📌 Overview
This recipe page was built to practice responsive design and semantic HTML. 

### 💡 The Challenge

Build out a responsive recipe page that includes ingredients, instructions, preparation time, and attractive styling — matching the design provided.

### 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git & GitHub for version control

### 🌱 What I Learned

- Leveraged semantic HTML to improve accessibility and structure.
- Practiced using custom properties for maintainable styling.
- Learned how to organize content hierarchically for readability and clarity.

```html
<section class="ingredients">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

```css
:root {
  --color-accent: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

Going forward, I’d like to:
- Practice building multi-page layouts
- Explore accessibility enhancements like ARIA roles
- Learn CSS animations for micro-interactions
